        A star system is a group of planets, meteors, or other objects that orbit a large star. While there are many
        star
        systems, including at least 200 billion other stars in our galaxy, there is only one solar system. That's
        because our sun is known by its Latin name,<br>
        <> The solar system includes everything that is gravitationally drawn into the sun's orbit. Astronomers have
            discovered there are many other large stars within our galaxy, the Milky Way. Use these resources to teach
            students about the objects and relationships within our solar system.

    The solar system is a vast cosmic neighborhood that comprises the Sun, <br>

    <h3 id="one">1.Mercury </h3>
    <img src="mercury.jpeg" height="250px" width="350px">
    <p> The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun,<br> Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's
        Moon.<br> From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times <br> as large as it does when
        viewed
      from Earth, <br>and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.</h4>

    <h3 id="two">2.Venus</h3>
    <img src="venusimage.webp" height="250px" width="350">
    <p>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and Earth's closest planetary neighbor.<br> It's the hottest planet in
        our
        solar system, and it is sometimes called Earth's twin. Further, <br> Venus may hold lessons about what it takes
        for
        life to get its start ­– on Earth, in our solar system, or across the galaxy. <br> The ingredients are all
        there, or
        at least, they used to be. <br> By studying why our neighbor world went in such a <br> different direction with
        regard to
        habitability, we could find out what could make other worlds right. <br> And while it might sound absurd, we
        can’t
        rule out life on Venus entirely. <br> Temperature, air pressure, and chemistry are much more congenial up high,
        in
        those thick, yellow clouds.</h>

    <h3 id="three">3.Earth Facts</h3>
    <img src="earth.jpeg" height="250px" width="350px">
    <p>Earth – our home planet – is the third planet from the Sun, <br>
        and the fifth largest planet. It's the only place we <br>
        know of inhabited by living things.Size and Composition: <br>
         Earth has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles) <br> 
         is composed primarily of rock and metal.
        Atmosphere: Our planet has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). <br>
         This atmosphere helps to sustain life by trapping heat and protecting us from harmful solar radiation.
        Water: Earth is often called the "Blue Planet" because of its abundant water. <br> 
        Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by oceans, with the remaining 29% consisting of continents and islands.</p>

    <h3 id="four">4.Mars Facts</h3>
    <img src="mars.jpeg" height="250px" width="350px">
    <p>Mars – the fourth planet from the Sun – is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. <br>
      This dynamic planet has seasons, polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons and weather. <br>
       Size and Composition: Mars has a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers (4,212 miles), making it roughly half the size of Earth. <br>
     It is primarily composed of rock and iron oxide, giving it its distinctive reddish color. <br>
    Atmosphere: Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide (95.3%), <br>
     with traces of nitrogen, argon, and other gases. The atmosphere is much thinner than Earth's, <br>
      exerting only about 0.6% of the surface pressure found on Earth.
        Surface Features: Mars is known for its diverse surface features, including vast deserts, canyons, <br>
     volcanoes, and polar ice caps. The largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is located on Mars, <br>
      along with Valles Marineris, a system of canyons stretching over 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles).</p>

    <img src="jupitar.jpeg" height="250px" width="350px">
    <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system – <br>
        if it were a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside. <br>
        It's also the oldest planet, forming from the dust and gases <br>
        left over from the Sun's formation 4.5 billion years ago.s not stable on the surface <br>
        due to the low atmospheric pressure, evidence suggests that water may exist in the form of ice beneath the surface. <br>
         Some scientists speculate that microbial life could potentially exist or have existed on Mars in the past.
        Exploration: Mars has been the subject of numerous robotic missions, including orbiters, <br>
         landers, and rovers, sent by various space agencies, such as NASA and ESA (European Space </p>
