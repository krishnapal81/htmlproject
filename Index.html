    <h1>Using Blogs in the Classroom</h1><br><br>
    <h3>Using Blogs in the Classroom</h3> <br>
    <p> Blogging can improve students’ writing skills and build their confidence as writers. By blogging,
        students can take ownership of their writing, become better observers of others’ writing, and
        develop a more immediate and powerful understanding of audience. Blogs encourage
        experimenting and risk-taking, seriousness and play, and they foster an increased awareness of
        private and public writing. Blogging blends both the freeing aspect of short pieces that can be
        written in a relatively low-stakes environment with the sense of claiming one’s own voice and
        learning how to develop analysis and articulate ideas to a larger public. Guided by clear
        expectations of what is required in a class blog, students can see their writing develop over the
        course of the term. This handout describes strategies for using blogs as a writing tool in the
        classroom</p>
    <h3>General Considerations</h3>
    <p>Although at first it may seem somewhat daunting when considering the perceived technical
        skills involved, using blogs in the classroom can be very rewarding. The learning curve is not as
        steep as you may imagine, and many resources for instructors (see Tech Support section below)
        exist on campus. Also, some students when learning to navigate the platform initially may resist
        blogging. But most students change their minds as they begin to blog.</p>

    <h3>Empowering Students</h3>
    <p>Students are used to writing and communicating in the digital landscape whether it be Twitter,
        FaceBook, Tumblr, or email. While reading their fellow students’ blogs and comments, and
        responding online with their own comments, students recognize the value of clarity and what
        makes for strong and engaging posts. Students have the opportunity to practice writing and
        analytical skills in their own blogs that will transfer into essays and other writing endeavors.
        Students are able to see their own writing as something “real” with a practical application.
        Creating a blog can be a bridge for students between the familiar digital world and what is being
        asked of them in academic essays, projects and other university-based assignments. Blogging
        can be seen as a gateway experience for students who will likely be using digital technologies
        and media in their future endeavors regardless of their discipline.</p> <br>
    <h3>Possible Uses for Instructors</h3>
    <h5>You may use blogging for:</h5>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>communicating announcements and assignments in a format that students <br> may
            perceive to be more “friendly” than CTools</li>
        <li>sharing instructor-generated exercises or prompts
        <li>
        <li> community building</li>
        <li>creating a public place where student work can be “published”</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Possible Uses for Students</h3>

    <ul type="disc">
        <li>responding to readings</li>
        <li> maintaining a writer’s notebook or journal</li>
        <li>posting personal, reflective, exploratory, or open entries (campus observations, <br> “where
            I’m from,” pictures from home, or favorite book or piece of writing) </li>
        <li> sharing student-generated research or links to class-related articles</li>

    <h3>In Practice</h3> <br>
    <h3>Choosing A Platform</h3> <br>
    Several user-friendly blogging platforms are commonly used in classrooms. No one platform is
    better suited to a specific discipline. Mostly the choice depends on your comfort level and
    personal preference when trying out each platform. For example, Tumblr (tumblr.com) works
    well for sharing images, quotes or brief chunks of text, or consolidating and linking to other
    sites. Google’s Blogger (blogger.com) is one of the flagship blogging platforms; it is intuitive and
    easy to start up, and allows for flexibility with color palettes and multiple fonts. Blogger and
    WordPress are both supported at the University by Instructional Support Services (ISS)

    <h3>Class Blog and Individual Student Blogs</h3>
    <p>There are many ways to use blogs in the classroom. Some instructors choose to create a class <br>
        blog that all enrolled students can contribute to by adding comments or by making individual <br>
        posts. Here is a screenshot of a class blog from WRITING 200 – winter 2013.</p>

            links to other websites they find interesting</dd>
